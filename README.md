# LanStellar: Decentralized Real Estate Platform
### Overview
LanStellar is a decentralized marketplace built on the Base Network. 
It serves as a platform for landowners to list their properties and 
for investors to purchase these properties securely through smart contracts.
It combines cutting-edge technology with unique features to create a secure, 
transparent, and efficient marketplace for property transactions.

### Key Features
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Ensures privacy and security of sensitive property information 
- Smart Contracts: Automates processes and ensures trustless transactions 
- Decentralized Storage: Securely stores property documents and information 
- NFT Tokenization: Receive a unique token URI and ID for secure transactions
- Automated Fees: 1% platform fee on every purchase, transferred automatically
- Basename Integration: Enhanced user experience with human-readable identifiers

### Getting Started

### How it Works

1 - Users undergo verification upon entering the marketplace
